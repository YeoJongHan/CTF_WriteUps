# ðŸ§  Brainhack's CDDC Finals 2023

The Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp is a CTF competition held within Singapore for students to participate in.

The challenges in the qualifiers and finals for the CTF this year was comparatively more difficult than the previous years.

My team participated in the **Polytechnic/ITE** category and we managed to take 1st place under our category in the finals.

I only managed to solve the heap challenge after the competition ended and it had only 2-3 solves during the competition, so I did a writeup on it.

## Challenges
